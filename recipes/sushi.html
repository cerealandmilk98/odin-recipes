    <h3>
      Sushi is a Japanese dish made of vinegared rice paired with seafood,
      vegetables, and sometimes fruit, all wrapped in nori. It's known for its
      fresh, balanced flavors.
    </h3>
    <p>
      To make sushi, you start by preparing sushi rice, which is seasoned with a
      mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Then, the rice is paired with
      fresh ingredients like raw fish, vegetables like cucumber or avocado, and
      sometimes a bit of wasabi for a kick. The rice and fillings are carefully
      rolled in sheets of nori, creating neat rolls. Sushi can also be made as
      nigiri, where slices of fish are placed directly on top of the rice.
